# Continuous Development Progress

**Session Started**: 2025-06-12 00:01:52
**Duration**: till 7am
**End Time**: 2025-06-12 07:00:00
**Focus Area**: General improvements (reliability, stability, testing)
**Current Status**: IN_PROGRESS

## Session Overview
- **Estimated Tasks**: 15-20 improvements across stability, testing, and code quality
- **Target Metrics**: 100% test pass rate, >80% coverage, zero critical bugs
- **Priority**: Critical bugs and failing tests first

## Completed Tasks ✅
1. **Initial Assessment** (00:01-00:05)
   - Status: COMPLETED ✅
   - All tests passing (3 packages tested)
   - Binary builds successfully
   - Test coverage critically low at 4.1%
   - No e2e tests found
   - Several TODOs found but no critical bugs

## Current Task 🔄
**Task**: Review codebase for critical bugs and stability issues (00:05-?)
- Status: IN_PROGRESS
- Examining core app logic
- Looking for error handling issues
- Checking for race conditions

## Pending Tasks 📋
- [ ] Fix any failing tests or build issues (none found so far)
- [ ] Identify and fix UI/UX issues
- [ ] Add missing e2e tests for critical user workflows
- [ ] Improve test coverage from 4.1% to >80%
- [ ] Add e2e tests for session management workflows
- [ ] Add e2e tests for git integration workflows
- [ ] Optimize performance bottlenecks
- [ ] Simplify complex code and remove unnecessary files
- [ ] Create comprehensive review guide for all changes

## Context for Next Session
- All tests passing but coverage extremely low (4.1%)
- No e2e tests exist - critical gap
- Binary builds and runs successfully
- Main areas needing tests: app, cmd, config, daemon, ui

## Issues & Blockers 🚫
- Extremely low test coverage is the biggest risk
- No e2e tests for user workflows

## Metrics Progress
- Tests: 14/14 passing ✅
- Coverage: 4.1% (target: >80%) ❌
- Build Status: Success ✅
- E2E Tests: 0 (needs implementation)

## Time Tracking
- Session time used: 0.1/7 hours
- Average task time: 4 minutes
- Estimated remaining tasks: 10-15
