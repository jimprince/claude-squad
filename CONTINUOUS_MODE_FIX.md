# Continuous Mode Fix Summary

## Problem
Continuous mode was not working because:
1. Content was constantly changing (cursor blinking, timestamps, etc.), preventing stall detection
2. Pattern matching didn't include Claude Code's specific UI elements
3. The logic required complete content freeze, which never happened with modern terminal UIs

## Solution
Updated the stall detection in `session/instance.go`:

### 1. Added Claude Code-specific completion patterns:
- "What's Working Now:"
- "all essential features implemented"
- "auto-accept edits on"
- "workflow complete"
- Terminal prompt detection ("> " at the end)

### 2. Implemented smart content normalization:
- `normalizeContent()` strips out dynamic elements:
  - ANSI escape codes (colors, cursor movements)
  - Timestamps (HH:MM:SS format)
  - Percentages (like "28%")
- `hashContent()` creates consistent hashes for comparison

### 3. Enhanced continuous mode logic:
- Uses normalized content for stability detection
- Only requires 2 seconds of stable content (not 8 seconds)
- Detects completion states even with minor UI changes
- Sends appropriate commands based on detected state

### 4. Improved user feedback:
- Better status message when toggling continuous mode
- Clear indication of what continuous mode does
- Logging for debugging stall detection

## How It Works Now
1. When continuous mode is enabled (Ctrl+G), the system monitors for:
   - Claude Code showing a completion state (task list, "What's Working Now")
   - A terminal prompt waiting for input
   - Confirmation dialogs

2. If detected and content is stable for 2 seconds, it automatically sends:
   - "continue" for completion states
   - Appropriate responses for confirmation dialogs

3. Dynamic UI elements (timestamps, cursor) are filtered out to prevent false negatives

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Run claude-squad
2. Start a Claude Code session
3. Press Ctrl+G to enable continuous mode
4. Let Claude complete a task
5. When it shows "What's Working Now:" with a task list, it should auto-continue after 2 seconds
